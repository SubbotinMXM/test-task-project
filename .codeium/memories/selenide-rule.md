You are an expert in Java UI automation, Selenide.

Code Style and Structure
Write concise, maintainable, and well-documented Java code using Selenide for UI automation.

Follow best practices for structuring test automation code: use Page Object pattern, avoid code duplication, and separate business logic from assertions.

Use descriptive, meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables (camelCase for methods/variables, PascalCase for classes).

Prefer composition over inheritance for page and component modeling.

Selenide-Specific Guidelines
Use Selenide’s native element search methods: $(selector), $$, Selectors.*.

Prefer stable and maintainable locators (data-test-id, unique class names, id, or robust XPath/CSS). Avoid brittle locators and duplication.

Never use Thread.sleep(); always use Selenide’s built-in waiting mechanisms (e.g., shouldBe, shouldHave, shouldDisappear).

All assertions and waits should be implemented using Selenide’s Condition classes.

Avoid direct Selenium WebDriver code (do not use driver.findElement, driver.manage(), etc.).

All test actions (clicks, inputs, etc.) and verifications (assertions) must be encapsulated in PageObject methods.

Always use explicit waits (shouldBe(Condition.visible), shouldHave(text(...))) before interacting with elements.

Never hardcode values or selectors in tests — store them in PageObjects as private final fields.

Test Structure and Best Practices

Avoid redundant assertions; group related assertions using AssertJ’s SoftAssertions where appropriate.

Parameterize tests when possible for reusability and coverage.

Page Object Model
Implement a clear Page Object Model (POM): one class per unique page, reusable components as separate classes.

All element locators and user actions must be defined in Page Objects, not in test classes.

All business flows should be represented as methods in Page Objects.

Maintainability
Reuse code by extracting reusable steps or helpers.

Keep selectors and page structure up-to-date; minimize selector fragility.

Add javadoc for public methods and classes; use clear method signatures.

Error Handling & Reporting
Implement clear, actionable assertion messages.

Use Selenide’s screenshot and page source auto-saving features for failed tests.

CI/CD Integration

Logging and Debugging
Use Selenide and SLF4J logging where relevant for steps and errors.

Avoid System.out.println or similar non-structured logging.

Performance & Stability
Use only necessary waits, avoid excessive or redundant conditions.

Prefer element scoping and context selectors to speed up searches.

Security & Clean Code
Never store credentials or secrets in code; use environment variables/configs.

Follow SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles.

Review and refactor code regularly to keep it concise and clean.

Follow best practices for:

UI automation structure and maintainability.

Reliable and robust element interaction using Selenide.

Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.

Adhere to Selenide, Java, and automation industry standards for clear, maintainable, and scalable UI tests.
